Introduction\n","\n","A much shorter version of the problem statement could be:  \n","**How many spanning trees are there in an $n \\times m$ maze where each node is connected to its up/down/left/right neighbors (if they exist)?**\n","\n","The solution is based on **Kirchhoff's theorem** (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kirchhoff%27s_theorem)).  \n","The theorem concerns the number of spanning trees in a graph, stating that this number can be computed in polynomial time from the determinant of a submatrix of the graph's Laplacian matrix — specifically, **the number equals any cofactor of the Laplacian matrix**.\n","\n","We can, of course, apply Kirchhoff's theorem to our specific graph: an $n \\times m$ grid where each node is connected to its up/down/left/right neighbors (if they exist). In our approach, we compute that number by evaluating a cofactor of its Laplacian matrix directly, rather than using the eigenvalue-based method.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"mujLVI68zYCL"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## 1. The Solution\n","\n","The solution is implemented in the method `number_spanning_trees(n, m)`.\n","\n","We first compute the Laplacian matrix using sparse matrices in `laplacian_grid_sparse`.\n","\n","Let's call this matrix `Lap`. Since we want to compute a (any) cofactor, we take for instance `Lap[1:,1:]`, removing the first row and column. So, we want to compute\n","$$\n","x = \\text{Lap}[1:,1:].\n","$$\n","\n","We perform the LU decomposition so that we have $ \\text{Lap}[1:,1:] = LU $, where $L$ is a lower triangular matrix and $U$ is an upper triangular matrix. Thus, we have $x = \\det L \\cdot \\det U$, and since both $L$ and $U$ are triangular, we have `det L = L.diagonal().prod()` and `det U = U.diagonal().prod()`. Therefore,\n","$$\n","x = L.\\text{diagonal()}. \\text{prod()} \\times U.\\text{diagonal()}. \\text{prod()}.\n","$$\n","\n","However, computing this directly would cause overflow. Since we want to express the solution in scientific notation $(a.bcd \\times 10^N)$,  \n","we take the logarithm base 10 on both sides, obtaining\n","$$\n","\\log_{10} x = \\text{np.log10(diagL).sum()} + \\text{np.log10(diagU).sum()}.\n","$$\n","\n","Now, instead of computing $10^{\\text{this number}}$ (which would overflow), we extract the mantissa $m \\in [1,10)$ and the exponent $p \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that\n","$$\n","x = m \\times 10^p,\n","$$\n","as desired. This is computed using  `frac, expo = np.modf(logdet10)`, `mantissa = 10**frac`, and `expo = int(expo)`."],"metadata":{"id":"E0VCk4BJ9L5F"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"7hpi6gR6F4L7","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761042716286,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":268,"user":{"displayName":"Ignasi Guillén","userId":"13527954759560798483"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["import numpy as np\n","import math\n","from scipy.sparse.linalg import splu\n","from scipy.sparse import lil_matrix, csc_matrix"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def laplacian_grid_sparse(n, m):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Construct the Laplacian matrix of an n x m grid graph in sparse CSC format.\n","    Each node is connected to its up/down/left/right neighbors (if they exist).\n","    Diagonal entries are the degree of each node, off-diagonals are -1 for edges.\n","    Using LIL format for assignment, then converted to CSC for efficient LU decomposition.\n","    \"\"\"\n","    N = n * m\n","    L = lil_matrix((N, N), dtype=int)\n","\n","    def idx(i, j):\n","        return i * m + j    #map (i, j) -> single index\n","\n","    for i in range(n):\n","        for j in range(m):\n","            k = idx(i, j)\n","            neighbors = []\n","            if i > 0: neighbors.append(idx(i-1, j))\n","            if i < n-1: neighbors.append(idx(i+1, j))\n","            if j > 0: neighbors.append(idx(i, j-1))\n","            if j < m-1: neighbors.append(idx(i, j+1))\n","\n","            for nb in neighbors:\n","                L[k, nb] = -1\n","            L[k, k] = len(neighbors)\n","\n","    return L.tocsc()  # convert to CSC directly for splu\n"],"metadata":{"id":"c7JQfJPjtDmv","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761042725201,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"Ignasi Guillén","userId":"13527954759560798483"}}},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def number_spanning_trees(n,m):\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Returns the number of spanning trees in an n x m grid graph.\n","    Each node is connected to its up/down/left/right neighbors (if they exist).\n","    \"\"\"\n","    Lap = laplacian_grid_sparse(n,m)\n","    # LU decomposition,\n","    lu = splu(Lap[1:,1:])# ,permc_spec='MMD_AT_PLUS_A')#\n","\n","    diagL = lu.L.diagonal()\n","    diagU = lu.U.diagonal()\n","\n","    # log10 of determinant\n","    logdet10 = np.log10(diagL).sum() + np.log10(diagU).sum()\n","\n","    # split into mantissa and exponent\n","    frac, expo = np.modf(logdet10)\n","    mantissa = 10**frac\n","    expo = int(expo)\n","\n","    print(f\"For a size of {n}x{m}, the number of mazes is {mantissa:.3f}e{expo}.\") #Equiv: {mantissa:.10f} × 10^{expo}.\")"],"metadata":{"id":"v0G34tDCr0pE","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761042726866,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":2,"user":{"displayName":"Ignasi Guillén","userId":"13527954759560798483"}}},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["pairs = [(1,1),(2,2),(4,3),(3,3), (10,15),(42,57),(342,357)]\n","import time\n","for n,m in pairs:\n","    t0 = time.time()\n","    number_spanning_trees(n,m)\n","    print(f\"elapsed time for a {n}x{m} maze is: {time.time()-t0:.2f} s\")\n","    print(\"...\")\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"fPcCJTGbsKCY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761042735696,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":4054,"user":{"displayName":"Ignasi Guillén","userId":"13527954759560798483"}},"outputId":"5e5584b8-8fdb-4b41-d7e6-052ed0789cac"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["For a size of 1x1, the number of mazes is 1.000e0.\n","elapsed time for a 1x1 maze is: 0.02 s\n","...\n","For a size of 2x2, the number of mazes is 4.000e0.\n","elapsed time for a 2x2 maze is: 0.00 s\n","...\n","For a size of 4x3, the number of mazes is 2.415e3.\n","elapsed time for a 4x3 maze is: 0.00 s\n","...\n","For a size of 3x3, the number of mazes is 1.920e2.\n","elapsed time for a 3x3 maze is: 0.00 s\n","...\n","For a size of 10x15, the number of mazes is 1.289e66.\n","elapsed time for a 10x15 maze is: 0.00 s\n","...\n","For a size of 42x57, the number of mazes is 1.148e1174.\n","elapsed time for a 42x57 maze is: 0.04 s\n","...\n","For a size of 342x357, the number of mazes is 1.609e61571.\n","elapsed time for a 342x357 maze is: 3.99 s\n","...\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"sPavkzrzvvwR"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
