        "For each digit $r \\in \\{1,3,4,6,7,8,9\\}$ (we cannot remove 0, 2, 5), let $D_r$ denote the largest possible GCD of the 9-digit numbers formed by the rows in a completed Sudoku puzzle that does not use the digit $r$.. Our goal is to find the maximum value among these,\n",
        "$$\n",
        "D := \\max_{r \\in \\{1,3,4,6,7,8,9\\}} D_r,\n",
        "$$\n",
        "and to identify a corresponding Sudoku puzzle that achieves this value.\n",
        "\n",
        "We proceed by fixing a digit $r$. Since $D_r$ divides every row sum in such a Sudoku, it must also divide the total sum of all rows. This total sum is $111,111,111 \\times (45 - r)$, because the sum of digits 0 through 9 is 45, and we are omitting $r$. In other words,\n",
        "$$\n",
        "D_r \\mid 111,111,111 \\times (45 - r).\n",
        "$$\n",
        "Therefore, $D_r$ must be a divisor of $111,111,111 \\times (45 - r)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our method is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. For each $r\\in \\{1,3,4,6,7,8,9\\}$, we enumerate all divisors of $111,111,111 \\times (45 - r)$.\n",
        "2. For each divisor, we check if it could be the GCD of a Sudoku row. A valid row would be an 8-digit number (since the first cell is 0) with all digits distinct, containing the digits 2 and 5 (which are always present), and excluding 0 as a leading digit and $r$ entirely. If a divisor cannot form such a number, we discard it as a candidate for $D_r$.\n",
        "3. We store the remaining candidate divisors along with their associated $r$.\n",
        "4. We then sort these (divisor, $r$) pairs in descending order by the divisor, omitting 1, as any completed Sudoku has a GCD of at least 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, we attempt to solve for a Sudoku puzzle that does not use the digit $r$ and where every completed row is a multiple of the current candidate divisor. Since we process the candidates in descending order, the first valid Sudoku we find must have the maximum possible GCD, $D$. This is because any larger GCD would have been a divisor of $111,111,111 \\times (45 - r)$ and would have been listed earlier."
